# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) with a simple goal: keep this space safe for caregivers, patients, clinicians, and researchers collaborating on life-and-death problems.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to create an open, empathetic, and harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or treatment choices.

## Standards

Positive examples:
- Using welcoming, accessible language.
- Respecting different care plans and cultural norms.

- Focusing on what helps patients and caregivers right now.

Unacceptable behavior:

- Sharing identifiable patient information without consent.
- Harassment in public or private channels.
- Publishing private communication without permission.

## Enforcement
