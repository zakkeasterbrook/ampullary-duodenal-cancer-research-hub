# Targeted & Immunotherapy

> **Evidence strength:**
> - MSI-H/dMMR/TMB-high ? Pembrolizumab FDA tumor-agnostic approval (KEYNOTE-158, NCT02628067)
> - HER2 amplification ? Trastuzumab ± pertuzumab case series + MyPathway basket trial
> - NTRK fusions ? Larotrectinib/entrectinib (STARTRK, LOXO-TRK)
> - KRAS G12C ? Sotorasib (CodeBreaK 100) & Adagrasib (KRYSTAL-1) biliary cohorts
> - BRCA/PALB2 ? PARP inhibitors (Olaparib) extrapolated from pancreatic cancer POLO trial

## Actionable alterations and therapies

| Alteration | Frequency (ampullary/duodenal) | Test | Therapy | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------------|------|---------|-------|
| MSI-H/dMMR | 3–5% (higher in intestinal type) | IHC, PCR, or NGS | Pembrolizumab or dostarlimab | Durable responses; check for Lynch syndrome |
| TMB-high (=10 mut/Mb) | 5–7% | NGS | Pembrolizumab (FDA label) | Confirm measurement method |
| HER2 amplification/overexpression | 5–15% | IHC + FISH | Trastuzumab + CAPOX/FOLFOX; add pertuzumab if tolerated | Monitor LVEF every 3 months |
| NTRK/ALK/ROS1 fusions | <1% | RNA-based NGS | Larotrectinib or entrectinib | Rapid responses; watch for CNS AEs |
| KRAS G12C | ~3% | DNA NGS | Sotorasib or adagrasib (off-label/basket) | Check liver enzymes monthly |
| BRAF V600E | 1–2% | DNA NGS | Dabrafenib + trametinib | Sun protection counseling |
| BRCA1/2, PALB2 | 2–4% | Germline + somatic testing | Olaparib maintenance or talazoparib | Screen for anemia/fatigue |
| FGFR2 fusions, IDH1 mutations | Rare | NGS | Pemigatinib (FGFR), ivosidenib (IDH1) | Evidence extrapolated from cholangiocarcinoma case reports |

## Testing strategy

1. **MMR IHC** on original tumor block.
2. **Comprehensive genomic profiling** (DNA + RNA) through commercial labs (FoundationOne CDx, Tempus xT, Caris, Guardant360 for ctDNA if tissue limited).
3. **HER2 IHC/FISH** regardless of subtype.
4. **Germline panel** for BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, Lynch genes when strong family history or young age (<60) even if patient currently 79 (impacts relatives and PARP eligibility).

## Immunotherapy pearls

- MSI-H/dMMR biliary tumors had ORR 41% and durable CRs in KEYNOTE-158.
- TMB-high (=10) qualifies for pembrolizumab only after prior therapy unless trial access.
- **PD-L1** expression alone does not predict benefit in ampullary cancer.
- Monitor for immune-related cholangitis; treat with steroids + hold therapy.

## HER2-directed therapy

- Small series report partial responses lasting 8–18 months with trastuzumab + CAPOX or trastuzumab + FOLFOX. Trastuzumab deruxtecan considered after progression if LVEF preserved.
- Baseline echocardiogram, repeat every 3 months.

## KRAS G12C inhibitors

- Case reports show disease control ~6 months with sotorasib after multiple lines.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37477998/)
- Watch for hepatotoxicity; avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers.

## PARP inhibitors

- Olaparib maintenance after platinum response is extrapolated from POLO trial; case reports in ampullary cancer show CA 19-9 decline and radiographic stability for 6–9 months.
- Hematologic monitoring biweekly for first 2 months.

## Clinical trial examples (as of 2026)

- **NCT05221385**: Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib for MSI-stable biliary cancers.
- **NCT05379507**: Zanidatamab (bispecific anti-HER2) for HER2+ biliary tract carcinomas.
- **NCT05033933**: RLY-4008 (FGFR2) basket including ampullary cholangiocarcinoma.
