# Surgery & Bypass Playbook

*Plain-language guide to Whipple procedures, bypass options, drains, and what happens when surgery isn’t possible.*

## 1. Who qualifies for surgery?

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Can the tumor be removed completely (R0/R1)?** | Imaging must show no major vessel encasement (SMA, SMV, celiac) and no distant metastases. |
| **Is performance status strong enough?** | Usually ECOG 0–1. Malnutrition, frailty, or severe comorbidities may delay or cancel surgery. |
| **Subtype matters?** | Both intestinal and pancreatobiliary types can be resected; pancreatobiliary has higher recurrence risk. |
| **Neoadjuvant chemo first?** | Increasingly common (e.g., FOLFIRINOX) to shrink tumors before surgery. |

If the tumor can’t be fully removed or patient isn’t fit, surgeons pivot to bypass or palliative procedures (see below).

## 2. The Whipple (pancreaticoduodenectomy)

  surgery[Whipple removes] -->|duodenum (first part)| stomach;
  surgery -->|gallbladder + bile duct head| bile;
  surgery -->|pancreas head| pancreas;
```

- Removes pancreatic head, duodenum, gallbladder, and part of bile duct.
- Reconstructs digestive tract so stomach, pancreas, and bile drain into the small intestine again.
- **Hospital stay:** 7–14 days; drains placed temporarily.
- **Recovery:** 6–12 months of enzyme replacement, small meals, watch blood sugars.

### Common questions

1. **“Does everyone get a Whipple?”** – No. Only when imaging + laparoscopy show no distant spread and vessels are free enough to reconstruct.
2. **“What if vessels are borderline?”** – Vascular reconstruction (SMV, portal vein) may be attempted at high-volume centers; referral matters.
3. **“Can you do robotic/laparoscopic?”** – Select centers offer minimally invasive Whipple; outcomes similar if surgeon has experience.

## 3. When surgery isn’t possible

### Biliary & gastric bypass options

| Procedure | When used | Analogy |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gastrojejunostomy** | Tumor blocks stomach outlet → surgeon connects stomach to small intestine past the blockage. | Creating a detour road around a traffic jam. |
| **Hepaticojejunostomy** | Bile duct completely blocked/non-stentable → surgeon connects bile duct directly to intestine. | Installing a new drain pipe upstream. |
| **Endoscopic stent (ERCP)** | First-line for most obstructions; metal stents last longer. | Putting a sleeve inside a clogged pipe. |
| **Percutaneous drain (PTBD)** | When ERCP fails or anatomy altered. External bag catches bile until internal route fixed. | Temporary gutter spout until main pipe repaired. |

### Bypass decision tree

1. **Blockage location?**
   - Bile duct only → ERCP stent → consider metal stent or hepaticojejunostomy.
   - Stomach outlet → gastrojejunostomy or stent.
2. **Expected survival >6 months?**
   - Surgical bypass or metal stent to minimize re-interventions.
3. **Performance status low?**
   - External drain + symptom control; avoid major surgery.

## 4. Drains 101

- **Internal stents** (plastic/metal) sit entirely inside ducts; nothing to flush at home, but beware itch/jaundice return.
- **External drains** (PTBD) exit the skin, attach to a bag. Need daily flush (per IR order), dressing changes, and weekly logs of output.
- **Combination** (“internal-external”) drains allow internal flow while giving access for flushing.

### Drain lifespan & maintenance

| Device | Typical duration | When to call IR |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Plastic stent | 4–6 weeks | Fever, jaundice, cholangitis signs |
| Metal stent | 4–12 months | Dark urine, itch, LFT spike |
| External drain | Until bypass or stent stable | Output ↓>50%, new abdominal pain, redness, smell |

## 5. Pain control procedures

- **Celiac plexus block / neurolysis:** Needle-based “nerve shut-off” to reduce upper abdominal/back pain, often done during EUS or CT-guided.
- **Ablation (RFA, NanoKnife):** Experimental for local control when lesions are borderline resectable.
- **Radiation (SBRT)** or **Y-90** may complement bypass when tumors threaten vessels but surgery isn’t feasible.

## 6. Frequently asked questions

1. **“Is bypass permanent?”** – Often yes. If chemo shrinks tumor enough, stents may be downsized/removed, but surgical bypass remains.
2. **“Can drains come out before chemo?”** – Usually once bilirubin is stable <2 mg/dL and imaging confirms good flow, IR can internalize or remove, but many keep them through initial chemo cycles.
3. **“What about infections?”** – Keep drain site clean, flush as instructed, monitor temp twice daily. Immediate ER visit for chills/rigors.
4. **“Does bypass delay chemo?”** – Typically 1–3 weeks post-op; coordinate with oncology.

## 7. Checklist before any procedure

- Review anticoagulants (stop per surgeon).
- Obtain latest labs (CBC, CMP, coag panel).
- Pack drain supplies + clothing that doesn’t tug on tubes.
- Confirm who removes stitches/staples and when.
- Schedule follow-up imaging to assess effect.
