# Radiation & Procedures

> **Evidence strength:** Guideline — NCCN; [Mumme et al., *Radiother Oncol.* 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34626552/); [ASGE Biliary Stent Guideline 2021](https://www.giejournal.org/article/S0016-5107(20)34870-1/fulltext)

## Plain-language summary

Radiation and GI procedures keep bile flowing, control pain, and occasionally debulk tumors. While they rarely cure metastatic disease, they buy time for systemic therapy and improve quality of life.

## Biliary decompression

| Option | Best for | Tips |
|--------|----------|------|
| ERCP + self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) | Most distal obstructions | Metal lasts 6–12 months; schedule exchange before clogging |
| Plastic stent | Short-term or bridging to surgery | Replace q8–12 weeks |
| EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy | Failed ERCP, duodenal stenosis | Requires experienced advanced endoscopist |
| Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD/PTHC) | Altered anatomy, urgent decompression | Educate on drain flushing, infection signs, dressing care |

**Antibiotics**: peri-procedural cipro/metronidazole or ceftriaxone per ASGE; extend if cholangitis.

## Gastric outlet obstruction

- **Duodenal stents** relieve vomiting quickly; patency ~3–6 months.
- **Gastrojejunostomy** for fit patients expected to live >6 months.

## Radiation therapy toolkit

| Modality | Indication | Dose | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)** | Dominant liver lesion, pain control | 30–50 Gy in 5 fractions | Hold chemo 1 week before/after; watch for biliary strictures |
| **Conformal/IMRT** | Primary tumor when unresectable | 45–54 Gy with 5-FU/capecitabine radiosensitization | Consider for bleeding or local pain |
| **Intraluminal brachytherapy** | Rarely used; inside bile duct | Boost after EBRT | Requires specialized center |

## Ablation & embolization

- **Yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y-90)**: case series show bilirubin drop allowing chemo; watch for post-embolization syndrome.
- **Microwave or radiofrequency ablation**: for =3 lesions <3 cm; pair with systemic therapy.

## Pain procedures

- **Celiac plexus block** via EUS or percutaneous route reduces opioid use.
- **Percutaneous nerve ablation** considered when opioids intolerable.

## Elderly patient considerations

- Pre-procedure evaluation of anticoagulation, renal function, and caregiver support for drains.
- For PTBD, ensure the patient or caregiver can flush drains twice daily and log output.

Coordinate closely with GI, interventional radiology, and radiation oncology; document goals (palliation vs conversion-to-resection) before interventions.
