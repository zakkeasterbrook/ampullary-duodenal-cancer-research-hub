# Future Frontiers & Idea Lab

> **Disclaimer:** These ideas are for brainstorming and research coordination only. Always run them past licensed physicians and clinical trial teams before acting.

## 1. Rapid discovery checklist

1. **Subtype + biomarkers:** MSI/MMR, HER2, KRAS, BRCA/PALB2, NTRK, FGFR2, TMB. Re-run sequencing when disease biology changes.
2. **Resistance snapshot:** trend ctDNA (Guardant/Signatera) every 2–3 cycles to catch new clones early.
3. **Combinational thinking:** look at pancreatic + cholangiocarcinoma literature when ampullary-specific data is sparse.

## 2. AI-assisted hypothesis board

| Question | AI prompt idea | Next action |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| “What low-toxicity combos extend quality of life for pancreatobiliary histology?” | `Summarize phase II trials mixing low-dose oxaliplatin with immunotherapy for pancreatobiliary ampullary cancer.` | Cross-check with NCCN + open trial list. |
| “How do we personalize enzyme dosing?” | `Create a table matching stool description to pancreatic enzyme units for ampullary cancer patients.` | Share output in Community Hub for caregiver testing. |
| “What wearable data predicts cholangitis?” | `List biomarkers + wearable metrics (temp, HRV) linked to biliary infections in GI cancer patients.` | Pilot logging in community spreadsheets. |

## 3. Emerging targets & trials

- **KRAS G12C**: adagrasib + EGFR inhibitor combos (KRYSTAL-10). Monitor for diarrhea & EGFR rash.
- **Claudin 18.2**: zolbetuximab trials expanding beyond gastric—screen intestinal phenotype ampullary cases.
- **DNA damage repair**: PARP combos (olaparib + gem/nab-paclitaxel) in patients with germline/somatic BRCA/PALB2.
- **Microbiome modulation**: FMT + immunotherapy pilot studies (check NCT05419362) for MSI-stable disease.

Use the [Clinical Trials](clinical-trials.md) page for structured search filters and outreach scripts.

## 4. Home experimentation (with doctor oversight)

| Concept | Rationale | Guardrails |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Circadian-friendly chemo scheduling** | Align infusion start with peak liver detox (morning) to reduce bilirubin spikes. | Discuss with infusion center; monitor labs.
| **Fasting-mimicking diet pre-chemo** | Early pancreatic studies show lower nausea & neutropenia. | Only with dietitian approval; watch glucose/weight. |
| **VR meditation for pain** | Reduces opioid use in small oncology cohorts. | Screen for vertigo, keep sessions <20 min. |

## 5. Data donation & analysis

1. Upload anonymized visit summaries via [Share Data Safely](share-data.md).
2. Tag entries with `#pain`, `#biliary`, `#chemo-cycle` to help agents cluster insights.
3. Agents run NLP to map symptom > intervention > outcome for continuous improvement.

## 6. Collaboration targets

- **Academic partners:** hepatobiliary tumor boards at major centers, pancreas SPORE programs.
- **Nonprofits:** PanCAN, Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation for grants + registry access.
- **Tech allies:** open-source AI communities to build symptom prediction tools (respecting privacy).

## 7. Submit your frontier idea

- Open an issue with the **New Topic / Research** template.
- Include evidence level, hypothesis, and what help you need (data, clinician, funding).
- Mark “Idea Lab” in the title so others can rally.

Together we can push beyond today’s standard of care, responsibly and transparently.
