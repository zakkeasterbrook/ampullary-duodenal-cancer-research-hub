# Caregiver HQ

Turn chaos into systems. Use this page to set up binders, trackers, and backup plans.

## 1. Command center checklist

- **Medical binder** sections: Contacts, Medication list, Labs/Imaging, Procedures, Bills/Insurance, Advance directives.
- **Digital hub** (Google Drive/Notion): upload scans, PDFs, drain photos, appointment notes.
- **Shared calendar**: chemo cycles, drain exchanges, family respite shifts.
- **Group chat**: caregivers share daily updates, needs, and wins.

## 4. Food & fatigue support

- Pre-chemo meal prep (soup, rice, protein shakes) so appetite dips still get calories.
- Snack bins by recliner (nuts, crackers, enzyme packs).
- Hydration station: water, electrolyte mix, straw cups.
- “Energy swaps”: lighten chores (grocery delivery, laundry service) and redirect energy toward symptom logs.

## 5. Mental health & respite

- Weekly respite block (friend/family takes over for 3 hrs).
- Tele-palliative or counselor check-ins for caregiver burnout.
- Gratitude + rant journal (two-column): vent on left, wins on right.

## 6. Emergency go-bag

- Copies of ID/insurance/card list.
- Latest labs + imaging summary.
- Drain supplies, spare caps, dressing kits.
- Comfort items (socks, charger, snacks).

## 7. Financial & legal checklist

- Track mileage, parking, hotel receipts for tax deductions or grants.
- Apply for assistance (PanCAN, CancerCare, foundations) early each quarter.
- Review/update POA, living will, HIPAA forms.

## 8. Collaboration tips

- Share anonymized visit summaries via [Share Data Safely](share-data.md).
- Add stories to [Community Stories](community/stories.md) so others learn faster.
- Use [Community Links](community-links.md) to tap into forums for niche questions (e.g., fenbendazole dosing, drain hacks).
