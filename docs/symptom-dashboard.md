# Symptom & Action Dashboard

Use this to know what’s “normal,” when to call the clinic, and when to go straight to the ER. Post it on the fridge.

| Symptom | What’s expected? | Home care | Call oncology | ER / 911 |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Fever** | Up to 100.3°F during chemo | Hydrate, recheck in 1 hr | ≥100.4°F once or persistent low-grade with chills | Fever + chills/rigors or drain present → ER (possible cholangitis) |
| **Jaundice / itch** | Mild yellowing can linger | Antihistamine, cholestyramine if prescribed | Bilirubin trend rising, stool/piss color changes | Rapid onset jaundice + fever = ER |
| **Drain output** | 300–800 mL/day depending on diet | Flush as ordered; change dressings | Output drop >50%, new dark sludge | No output + pain or leak → ER/IR |
| **Pain** | 0–3 manageable at home | Heat packs, Tylenol, opioid as prescribed | >6 despite meds or new sharp pain | Sudden severe pain + fever/rigors |
| **Nausea/vomiting** | Mild after chemo | Ondansetron on schedule, ginger, hydration | Can’t keep meds/fluids down for >12h | Vomit + coffee-ground or green bile |
| **Stool changes** | Loose during enzymes titration | Adjust enzymes, BRAT diet | Black/tarry stools, >5 watery stools/day | Blood in stool or severe dehydration |
| **Breathing issues** | Mild shortness of breath on exertion | Incentive spirometer, walk laps | SOB at rest, chest pressure | Sudden SOB, chest pain, confusion |
| **Edema** | Mild ankle swelling during steroids | Elevate legs, compression socks | Rapid weight gain, tight skin | Swelling + shortness of breath |
