# Staging & Prognosis

> **Evidence strength:** Guideline — AJCC 8th Edition; [Kim et al., Cancer 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20939066/); [Halfdanarson et al., J Gastrointest Oncol 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998046/)

## Plain-language summary

Staging uses the AJCC TNM system. Once liver metastases exist, the cancer is stage IV. Prognosis depends on subtype, nodal status, resection margin, and performance status. Outlier survivors typically had intestinal subtype, low tumor burden, effective biliary drainage, and access to multiple lines of therapy.

## AJCC 8th edition snapshot

| Stage | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| I | Tumor limited to ampulla/duodenum (=T1) without nodes |
| II | Invasion into pancreas or peripancreatic soft tissue (T2–T3) and/or 1–3 nodes |
| III | >3 nodes or invasion into major vessels/organs (T4) |
| IV | Distant metastasis (liver, peritoneum, lung) |

Even after Whipple surgery, recurrence rates approach 50–60%; thus adjuvant chemo (capecitabine or FOLFOX) is advised.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20939066/)

## Prognostic factors in metastatic setting

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Subtype | Pancreatobiliary median OS 11–15 mo; intestinal 20–30 mo even when metastatic |
| Nodal status | =4 positive nodes worsens OS by ~40% |
| Margin (if resected) | R0 improves OS (32 vs 17 mo) in localized disease |
| Liver metastasis number | =3 lesions amenable to SBRT/Y-90 correlate with longer OS |
| CA 19-9 | >1000 U/mL predicts poor chemo response; watch for Lewis antigen-negative status |
| Performance status | ECOG 0–1 vs =2 doubles median OS |

## Survival data highlights

- Ampullary carcinoma overall 5-year survival ranges 20–50% (localized) but <10% once metastatic.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998046/)
- Duodenal adenocarcinoma metastatic median OS 12–18 months with modern chemo.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998046/)
- Modified FOLFIRINOX in pancreatobiliary ampullary cancer yields OS ~15 months; gemcitabine/cisplatin ~11–12 months; best supportive care 4–6 months.[5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194228/)

## Outlier survival stories (documented)

| Scenario | Details | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Intestinal subtype + MSI-H | Underwent Whipple, recurred with lung mets, long-term CR on pembrolizumab (>3 years) | [KEYNOTE-158 subgroup](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02628067)
| HER2+ ampullary cancer | Achieved 18-month disease control on trastuzumab + CAPOX | [ASCO GI 2022 case series](https://meetinglibrary.asco.org)
| Liver oligometastases + systemic therapy | FOLFIRINOX + SBRT to two liver lesions ? OS 28 months | [SBRT cohort, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34626552/)

## Performance status tools

- **ECOG** (0–4) quick in clinic.
- **Karnofsky** scale (100–0) helpful for geriatric assessment.
- **G8 screening tool** recommended by SIOG for patients =70.[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32211875/)

## Prognostication pearls for families

1. Ask for the **exact AJCC stage** and whether tumor board reviewed the case.
2. Request the **full pathology report** (with subtype, margins, nodes, MMR).
3. Discuss **realistic ranges** (best case, expected, worst case) rather than a single number.
4. Revisit prognosis after each restaging scan; treatment response matters more than initial median survival once therapy starts.
