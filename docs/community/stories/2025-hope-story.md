> We turned biliary drain care into a kitchen chore chart so nothing slipped. Output tracked in a shared Google Sheet prevented ER trips.

- **What helped:** nightly flushes (50 mL), spare caps in every room, IR nurse on speed dial.

- **Mindset:** Saturday night “game show” with mom during chemo pump kept morale up.
