## Drain assignments saved our nights
*Role:* caregiver | *Stage:* IV with liver mets | *Year:* 2025

> We turned biliary drain care into a kitchen chore chart so nothing slipped. Output tracked in a shared Google Sheet prevented ER trips.

- **What helped:** nightly flushes (50 mL), spare caps in every room, IR nurse on speed dial.
- **Biggest lesson:** call at bilirubin 2.0 instead of waiting—metal stent swap was painless.
- **Mindset:** Saturday night “game show” with mom during chemo pump kept morale up.
