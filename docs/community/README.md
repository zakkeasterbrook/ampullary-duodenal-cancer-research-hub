## Templates

### Caregiver / Patient Story

`docs/community/templates/story.md`

Highlights lived experience, what helped, and what to ask clinicians.

### Research Drop

`docs/community/templates/research.md`

Summarizes a paper/trial with plain-language takeaways.

### Checklist / Playbook

`docs/community/templates/playbook.md`

Step-by-step workflows (e.g., drain maintenance, feeding tube care).

### Clinic Note Digest / MyChart Summary

`docs/community/templates/clinic-note.md`

Turn a clinical note into anonymized bullet points (no names, MRNs, dates). Great for spotting patterns across care teams.

## Safety reminders

- **Redact identifiers:** remove names, MRNs, birth dates, addresses, appointment dates, and hospital account numbers.
- **Summarize, don’t upload PDFs.** Rephrase doctor impressions instead of attaching original records.
- **State evidence level:** anecdote vs guideline vs trial.
- Encourage readers to confirm with their medical team.
