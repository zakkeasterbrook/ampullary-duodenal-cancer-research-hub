# Integrative Evidence & Safety Guide

Use this page when you want credible lifestyle, supplement, and mind-body data—not rumor threads. Every link points to a guideline, trial, or reputable database so you can talk with your oncology team confidently.

## 1. Nutrition & activity guidelines

| Resource | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| [American Cancer Society Nutrition & Physical Activity Guideline for Survivors](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/supportive-care/nutrition-activity-with-cancer/acs-nutrition-and-physical-activity-guideline-for-survivors.html) | Evidence-based advice on diet patterns, activity, alcohol, and weight. |
| [Guideline publication (Rock et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294043/) | Primary paper with methodology and references.
| [NCCN Healthy Living patient guideline (PDF)](https://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/content/PDF/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf) | Practical handout for diet, exercise, mental health, and symptom tracking.
| [NCCN patient guideline library](https://www.nccn.org/patientresources/patient-resources/guidelines-for-patients) | Download cancer-specific patient booklets.

### Post-stent/bypass eating (quick recap)
- Small, frequent meals (5–6/day) with 15–20 g protein + healthy fat; take enzymes with every bite.
- Hydration goal: ~30 mL/kg/day (use electrolyte packets during chemo).
- Sit upright 30 minutes after eating, walk short laps, keep anti-nausea meds nearby.

## 2. Diet strategies people ask about

| Topic | Real evidence |
|-------|---------------|
| **Ketogenic diet** | [2025 systematic review/meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1535921/full) looked at controlled trials; found modest body-composition/symptom effects but no proof of tumor control. |
| **Fasting / intermittent energy restriction** | [2025 British Journal of Cancer trial](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-025-03129-8) + [NCT04027478](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04027478) show research is ongoing; systematic review cited in the paper found no consistent chemo-toxicity reduction yet. |
| **Vitamin D** | [Meta-analysis (2019)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6821324/) and [2023 IPD meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10214278/) reported lower total cancer mortality with D3 supplementation, not lower incidence. |

## 3. Cannabis & symptom relief

- [ASCO guideline (full text)](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.23.02596) / [PubMed summary](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38478773/): recommend **against** using cannabis/cannabinoids as cancer-directed therapy outside trials, but acknowledge potential for symptom control (pain, nausea/appetite) under supervision.

## 4. Mind-body & supportive therapies (SIO-ASCO guideline)

- [PubMed entry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37582238/)
- [JCO full text](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.23.00857)
- [SIO announcement](https://integrativeonc.org/latest-news/sio-asco-releases-guidelines-on-integrative-oncology-care-of-symptoms-of-anxiety-and-depression-in-adults-with-cancer/)

Highlights: yoga, mindfulness, relaxation, music therapy, and acupuncture carry moderate-to-strong evidence for anxiety/depression relief; hypnosis for procedure distress; massage for short-term mood benefits.

## 5. Supplements & herb interactions

| Tool | Why use it |
|------|-----------|
| [MSK About Herbs search](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/search) | Evidence summaries + known interactions for herbs, botanicals, and supplements. |
| [MSK About Herbs overview](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs) | Methodology and reviewer info. |
| [MSK FAQ on chemo interactions](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/herbs-botanicals-other-products-faqs) | Plain-language warnings about CYP changes, bleeding risk, etc. |

## 6. NCI CAM / integrative therapy fact-check

- [NCI PDQ CAM summaries](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/cam)
- [NCI CAM overview](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam)

Each PDQ entry gives mechanism, clinical data, and safety for therapies like mistletoe, acupuncture, herbal formulas, etc.

## 7. Caregiver resources

- [Expert commentary: bring caregivers into care decisions (2026)](https://news.mays.tamu.edu/uncategorized/2026/01/expert-calls-for-greater-role-of-family-caregivers-in-cancer-care-decisions/) — matches the actionable checklists in our [Caregiver HQ](caregiver-hq.md).
