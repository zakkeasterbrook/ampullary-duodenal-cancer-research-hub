# Alternative & Exploratory Toolkit

> **Disclaimer:** The therapies below are not standard of care. Many lack randomized data or can interfere with chemotherapy. Always review them with licensed physicians before attempting anything. Choosing alternative medicine **instead of** conventional therapy is linked to much worse survival ([NCI analysis](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/alternative-medicine-cancer-survival); [JAMA Oncology data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30027204/)). Use this page to inform evidence-based conversations, not to replace proven care.

## Ivermectin

- **Claim:** Antiparasitic drug that “starves” cancer cells and reverses drug resistance.
- **Mechanism hypothesis:** Inhibits P-glycoprotein, disrupts WNT/TGF-β signaling, induces immunogenic cell death (mostly in vitro).
- **Evidence check:** *Anecdote / preclinical.* No human trials for ampullary/duodenal cancers. One phase I trial (NCT02338992) in hematologic malignancies halted.
- **Risks:** Liver enzyme elevation, interaction with CYP3A4 drugs (irinotecan, paclitaxel). High doses can cause neurotoxicity.

  - Reddit ivermectin hub: https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/
  - r/cancer search tip: https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/search/?q=ivermectin+ampullary&restrict_sr=1
- **Clinical guidance:** Oncologists caution against combining with platinum regimens without monitoring LFTs.

## Fenbendazole ("Joe Tippens protocol")

- **Claim:** Dog dewormer (200 mg every other day) plus vitamin E, curcumin, CBD leads to remission.
- **Mechanism hypothesis:** Microtubule disruption similar to mebendazole; may inhibit glucose uptake.
- **Evidence check:** *Anecdote.* One case report (lung cancer) in 2018. **Key update:** the frequently cited case series was [retracted](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41574240/) (see [PubMed entry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40605964/)). Treat it as unreliable.
- **Risks:** Hepatotoxicity, neutropenia when combined with chemo, quality-control issues buying vet meds.
- **Community links:**
  - Joe Tippens blog: https://www.mycancerstory.rocks/
  - Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/mycancerstory.rocks/
  - Reddit search: https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/search/?q=fenbendazole&restrict_sr=1
- **Advice:** Never substitute for chemo; if attempting under medical supervision, prefer pharmaceutical-grade mebendazole and frequent labs.

## High-dose Vitamin C

- **Claim:** IV infusions (25–75 g) act as pro-oxidant, enhancing chemo and reducing fatigue.
- **Mechanism:** Generates hydrogen peroxide in tumor microenvironment; may synergize with gemcitabine.
- **Evidence:** *Phase I/II pilot* (Ma et al., 2019) in pancreatic cancer showed improved fatigue but no OS advantage. Trials (NCT03146962) still recruiting.
- **Risks:** Kidney stones, G6PD deficiency hemolysis, interference with lab glucose readings.

## Mistletoe (Viscum album)

- **Claim:** Subcutaneous injections boost immunity, improve QoL, reduce chemo side effects.
- **Evidence:** *Case series / small RCTs* mostly in breast/GI cancers; improves symptom scores, no clear survival data. ASCO 2023 poster in pancreatic cancer showed fatigue improvement.
- **Risks:** Local reactions, allergic responses; can trigger fevers mistaken for infection.
- **Access:** Does not have FDA approval but can be prescribed via compounding pharmacies (e.g., Helixor). Requires MD willing to oversee.

## Metformin (repurposed)

- **Claim:** Diabetes drug lowers insulin/IGF signaling, slowing tumor growth and enhancing chemo.
- **Evidence:** *Retrospective cohorts* show improved OS in diabetic pancreatic/biliary patients. Ongoing trials combining with FOLFIRINOX (NCT02336087).
- **Risks:** Lactic acidosis (rare), GI upset; must monitor renal function.
- **Tip:** Legit prescription easier for patients with insulin resistance or steroid-induced hyperglycemia.

## Low-dose naltrexone (LDN)

- **Claim:** 1.5–4.5 mg nightly reduces pain, improves immune surveillance, helps neuropathy.
- **Evidence:** *Small case series* (pain & autoimmune). No ampullary-specific trials; used off-label.
- **Risks:** Insomnia, vivid dreams; interacts with opioids (blocks analgesia).

## Hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT)

- **Claim:** Increases oxygenation, making tumors more chemo/radiation-sensitive and helping wound healing.
- **Evidence:** *Case reports* in radiation injury, limited oncology data. Some pancreatic centers test HBOT + chemo.
- **Risks:** Ear barotrauma, seizure risk if combined with certain drugs.

## Ozone therapy

- **Claim:** IV ozone or autohemotherapy detoxifies blood and boosts immune response.
- **Evidence:** *Anecdote.* No peer-reviewed trials for GI cancers; banned in some jurisdictions.
- **Risks:** Air embolism, oxidative damage, unregulated providers.

## Other crowd ideas

| Therapy | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Doxycycline + Ivermectin combo** | Proposed for anti-parasitic synergy; zero human data. Monitor for GI upset + sun sensitivity. |
| **Curcumin IV** | Limited availability; oral forms poorly absorbed. Pause around chemo to avoid CYP interactions. |
| **Black seed oil (thymoquinone)** | Antioxidant claims; only cell-line data. |
| **Cannabis high-THC protocols** | Helps appetite, sleep, neuropathy. For anti-tumor effect, data is anecdotal. |
| **Fasting / keto** | Some pancreatic patients report less nausea; requires strict dietitian oversight to prevent weight loss. |

## How to contribute safely

1. Use the [clinic-note template](community/templates/clinic-note.md) or “Human Story” issue to describe doses/results.
2. Label each entry with evidence level.
3. Never share exact prescriptions or encourage stopping doctor-recommended therapy.
4. Tag posts with `#alternative` in Community Hub so agents and clinicians can review.

## What we still need

- Aggregated outcomes: Did someone combine fenbendazole + FOLFIRINOX? How were labs?
- Toxicity tracking: LFT spikes, neuropathy flares when adding supplements.
- Trial leads: If a legit study opens, we’ll move it to the Clinical Trials page.

Share responsibly. The more data we gather (even anecdotal), the faster we can pressure-test these ideas.
