# Clinical Trials & Investigational Options

**Use cases:** identify escalation paths beyond standard chemotherapy, especially for biomarker-selected cohorts and older adults needing creative trial designs.

## Trial archetypes to know

| Category | Representative Trials (2024–2026) | Eligibility Highlights | Why it matters |
|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **KRAS G12C inhibitors** | KRYSTAL-10 (adagrasib + standard chemo), CodeBreaK-300 (sotorasib + panitumumab) | Metastatic biliary or pancreatic cancers harboring KRAS G12C | Provides targeted salvage after platinum failure; oral agents with manageable toxicity |
| **DNA damage response (DDR) trials** | NCT05668645 (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel + olaparib), NCT05323181 (ATR inhibitor ceralasertib + durvalumab) | BRCA/PALB2/ATM mutations or HRD signature | Extends benefit of platinum sensitivity and introduces PARP maintenance |
| **Immunotherapy combos** | TOPAZ-1 style durvalumab + gemcitabine/cisplatin expansion, NCT05581268 (nivolumab + relatlimab) | Biliary tract cancers regardless of PD-L1; some require MSI-H/TMB-high | Offers durable responders beyond MSI-high subset |
| **FGFR/IDH/Claudin18.2 baskets** | FOENIX-CCA3 (futibatinib), NCT05201646 (zolbetuximab + CAPOX) | Molecularly selected biliary tract or upper GI tumors | Opens targeted options previously available only to cholangiocarcinoma |
| **Radiation + systemic therapy** | NCT05446265 (SBRT + FOLFIRINOX), Proton therapy registries | Limited liver metastases, KPS ≥70, adequate liver reserve | For symptom control, biliary patency, or oligoprogression containment |
| **Pancreatic-like adaptive trials** | Precision Promise (Adaptive Platform for Pancreatic Cancer) | Accepts ampullary cases with pancreatobiliary histology; requires biopsy for biomarkers | Provides rapid crossover between arms and embedded translational research |

## How to search quickly

1. **ClinicalTrials.gov filters**
   - Condition: "Ampullary Carcinoma" OR "Duodenal Adenocarcinoma" OR "Biliary Tract Cancer"
   - Recruitment: "Recruiting" + "Active, not recruiting" for pragmatic options
   - Interventions: targeted drug of interest ("adagrasib", "trastuzumab deruxtecan")
   - Location: enable country + radius; consider virtual consent trials

2. **Trial finder shortcuts**
   - [NCI Cancer Trials Search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search)
   - [Fight CRC Precision Medicine Locator] (works for upper GI as well)
   - [Emerald Foundation KRAS G12C list](https://krasg12c.org/trials)

3. **Leverage molecular reports**
   - FoundationOne, Caris, Tempus include "Matching Trials" sections; extract NCT IDs
   - Contact the sponsoring investigator directly—rare cancers often allow compassionate enrollment even if formal slots are pancreatic/biliary biased

## Triage framework for a 79-year-old with ECOG 2

1. **Stabilize locally**: biliary drainage optimized, nutrition, infection control.
2. **Assess travel tolerance**: map centers within 3 hours (Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, Mayo Clinic, MSK remote).
3. **Pre-screen labs**: total bilirubin <2 mg/dL, ANC >1500, platelets >100k are common cutoffs.
4. **Bundle imaging**: obtain recent CT/MRI + pathology slides for rapid review.
5. **Prepare one-page medical summary** to email coordinators (include comorbidities, medications, caregiver support).

## Example outreach email

```text
Subject: Pre-screen request - KRAS G12C ampullary carcinoma (NCT05934567)

Hello [Coordinator],

We are seeking compassionate enrollment for a 79-year-old woman with pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma harboring KRAS G12C and liver metastases. Current status: post biliary stent, bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL, ECOG 2 but improving, no ascites. Prior therapy: 2 cycles dose-modified FOLFOX (oxaliplatin held on cycle 2 due to neuropathy). No brain mets.

Attached: pathology report, molecular profile, latest imaging.

Is there flexibility for ECOG 2 with documented caregiver support? Would home labs be acceptable?

Thank you,
[Name], caregiver

## When trials are not feasible

- Request **expanded access or single-patient IND** via treating oncologist (particularly for adagrasib or trastuzumab deruxtecan if biomarker-positive).
- Pursue **molecular tumor board** recommendations documented in the EHR to bolster insurance appeals for off-label targeted therapy.
- **Track compassionate use waitlists** maintained by drug companies; enroll early because paperwork takes 4–6 weeks.
