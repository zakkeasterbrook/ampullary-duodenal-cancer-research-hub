# Integrative & Supportive Care

Comprehensive supportive care combines palliative medicine, evidence-informed integrative therapies, and day-to-day logistics so systemic treatment can proceed safely.

## Core supportive domains

### 1. Symptom control (palliative care)
- **Biliary obstruction:** schedule prophylactic ERCP or drain checks every 6–8 weeks; monitor bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and skin color.
- **Pain:** layer long-acting opioids (methadone, morphine ER) with breakthrough agents and interventional options (celiac plexus block, intrathecal pump). Incorporate neuropathic agents (duloxetine, pregabalin) early.
- **Pruritus:** cholestyramine, sertraline, or rifampin plus UV therapy as needed.
- **Nausea:** rotate dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine), 5-HT3 blockers, NK1 inhibitors, and olanzapine; ensure bowel regimen.

### 2. Nutrition & metabolism
- **Guidelines to anchor on:** [ACS Nutrition & Physical Activity Guideline](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/supportive-care/nutrition-activity-with-cancer/acs-nutrition-and-physical-activity-guideline-for-survivors.html) + [NCCN healthy living patient guide](https://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/content/PDF/survivorship-hl-patient.pdf) emphasize plant-forward eating, weight management, and daily movement.
- **Pancreatic enzyme replacement**: weight-based dosing (500–1000 lipase units/kg/meal). Use acid suppression if steatorrhea persists.
- **After stent/bypass:** small, frequent meals (5–6/day) with 15–20 g protein + healthy fat in each; avoid huge portions that stress the new plumbing.
- **Hydration goal:** 30 mL/kg/day; use electrolyte packets on chemo days.
- **High-calorie snacks:** 250–300 kcal shakes with MCT oil, Greek yogurt, nut butter; track intake via app (Cara Care, MyFitnessPal).
- **Glycemic swings:** coordinate with endocrinology when on steroids or if partial pancreatectomy occurred. Continuous glucose monitoring benefits frail patients.

#### Sample day of eating (post-stent/bypass)
- **Breakfast:** scrambled eggs with spinach + 2 enzyme caps, slice of toast with nut butter, warm tea.
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt mixed with MCT oil and berries.
- **Lunch:** soft baked fish, mashed sweet potatoes, steamed carrots.
- **Snack:** high-calorie shake (Ensure/Boost + banana + spoon of olive oil).
- **Dinner:** shredded chicken soup with rice noodles, avocado slices, enzyme caps.
- **Bedtime:** cottage cheese or protein pudding to prevent overnight weight loss.

Tips: sit upright 30 minutes after meals, walk short laps to aid digestion, and keep anti-nausea meds handy to maintain intake.

### 3. Functional status & rehab
- **Physical therapy**: focus on gait stability, seated strength work, and inspiratory muscle training to protect against deconditioning.
- **Occupational therapy**: home safety assessments, adaptive equipment (shower chair, grab bars), and fatigue pacing education.
- **Cognitive support**: screen for chemo-brain; memory notebooks and caregiver-shared calendars reduce confusion.

### 4. Integrative therapies (evidence-rated)

| Modality | Evidence summary | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Acupuncture** | Moderate evidence for nausea, neuropathy relief in GI cancers (ASCO Integrative Guideline 2022) | Ensure platelets >75k to avoid bleeding risk |
| **Mindfulness-based stress reduction** | Randomized trials show improved sleep and anxiety scores | Free programs via UCLA Mindful, Calm app libraries |
| **Omega-3 fatty acids (2–3 g/day EPA+DHA)** | Meta-analyses show weight stabilization in cachexia | Monitor bleeding risk if on anticoagulants |
| **Curcumin** | Limited human data; potential CYP3A4 interactions | Avoid during irinotecan or targeted therapy unless cleared by pharmacist |
| **Mistletoe injections, high-dose vitamin C** | No proven survival benefit; consider only within supervised integrative oncology programs | Document in EMR to avoid drug interactions |

### 5. Care coordination
- **Weekly huddles**: 15-minute video call including oncologist nurse, palliative NP, nutritionist, and caregiver to align on labs, symptoms, and schedule.
- **Emergency packet**: binder with medication list, allergies, most recent labs, imaging CD/USB, and advanced directives—kept near the door.
- **Financial navigation**: social workers can expedite co-pay grants (PAN Foundation, CancerCare). Apply early before funds deplete.

## Checklist: first 72 hours after hospital discharge

1. Confirm stent/drain maintenance instructions + supplies.
2. Schedule follow-up labs within 5 days.
3. Arrange home health for drain care if caregiver uncomfortable.
4. Sync medications into one pharmacy and set alarms (MediSafe app).
5. Book tele-palliative visit within 1 week.
6. Start enzyme therapy and log symptoms to titrate dosing.
7. Set up shared document for weight, intake, stools, pain scores.

## When to escalate

- Fever >100.4°F or rigors → immediate ER due to cholangitis risk.
- Bilirubin jumping >2 mg/dL within a week → urgent GI/hepatobiliary consult.
- Rapid weight loss (>5% in 1 month) despite enzymes → refer to oncology dietitian and consider appetite stimulants (megestrol, olanzapine) or enteral support.
- Refractory pain despite escalating opioids → interventional pain or radiation consult.
