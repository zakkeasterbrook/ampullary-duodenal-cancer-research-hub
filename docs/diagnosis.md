# Diagnosis & Subtypes

> **Evidence strength:** Guideline — NCCN Hepatobiliary Cancers v2.2024; [Westgaard et al., Ann Surg Oncol 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)

## Plain-English snapshot

Doctors answer three questions:
1. **Where did the tumor start?** (ampulla vs duodenum)
2. **What does it look like under the microscope?** (intestinal vs pancreatobiliary)
3. **What switches are flipped in the DNA?** (MMR, HER2, KRAS, etc.)

Those answers predict whether the cancer behaves like colon cancer (slower, likes 5-FU) or like pancreatic cancer (faster, likes FOLFIRINOX/gemcitabine doublets).

## How the diagnosis comes together

1. **Red-flag symptoms** – jaundice, itchy skin, pale stools, abdominal pain, vomiting after meals, GI bleeding.
2. **Imaging & scopes** – pancreas-protocol CT or MRI/MRCP map the plumbing; EUS or ERCP takes tiny biopsies. Think of EUS as an ultrasound wand pressed from inside the stomach, while ERCP is a “pipe snake” that also places stents.
3. **Lab clues** – liver panel, bilirubin fractions, CA19-9, CEA. Rising bilirubin often means the “pipes” are blocked.
4. **Pathology workup** – stains such as CK7/CK20, MUC1/MUC2, CDX2 plus mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) classify the tumor.

## Subtypes explained with analogies

- **Intestinal type**: looks like the lining of the small intestine/colon. Imagine a velvet carpet—softer, more organized. Median survival in localized disease 30–40 months.
- **Pancreatobiliary type**: thicker, scar-like tissue from the bile/pancreas ducts; behaves like a more aggressive weed patch. Median survival 12–20 months.
- **Mixed**: patches of both carpets; outcomes sit in the middle.

## DNA & biomarker cheat sheet

| Biomarker | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **KRAS** (40–60%) | Drives aggressiveness; G12C mutations unlock adagrasib/sotorasib combos |
| **TP53 / SMAD4 / CDKN2A** | “Brakes” lost in pancreatic-style disease |
| **MSI-H / dMMR (~5%)** | Opens pembrolizumab/dostarlimab door |
| **HER2 (5–15%)** | Consider trastuzumab or trastuzumab deruxtecan |
| **BRCA1/2 / PALB2 (2–4%)** | Signals platinum sensitivity + PARP options |
| **NTRK/ALK/ROS1 fusions (<1%)** | Tumor-agnostic targeted therapies |

## Distinguishing from mimics

- **Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma:** tumor bulk in pancreatic head, often wraps vessels (SMA/SMV), CA19-9 can spike >1000.
- **Distal cholangiocarcinoma:** hugs the bile duct itself; more “sleeve-like” growth.
- **Duodenal adenocarcinoma (non-ampullary):** lesion away from the papilla, sometimes villous.
- **Neuroendocrine tumors:** well-circumscribed, chromogranin/synaptophysin positive.

## Confirming liver spread

- MRI with hepatobiliary contrast (gadoxetate) or triphasic CT shows small lesions best.
- Biopsy if pathology is uncertain or a clinical trial needs fresh tissue.
- Map portal vein patency and bile duct dilation before deciding on drains or embolization.

## Biliary obstruction toolbox (plumbing guide)

- **ERCP with stent** – first-line “pipe relining.” Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) last longer if expected survival >4 months.
- **EUS-guided drainage** – if the scope can’t reach through a blocked duodenum, the doctor pokes a new channel under ultrasound guidance.
- **Percutaneous drain (PTBD/PTHC)** – the “chimney vent” placed through the skin when other routes fail or urgent decompression is needed. Requires daily flushes and infection vigilance.

Having the subtype + biomarker profile documented unlocks the treatment sections that follow. Keep a copy of the pathology report—it becomes the roadmap for every future decision.
