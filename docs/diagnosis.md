# Diagnosis & Subtypes

> **Evidence strength:** Guideline — NCCN Hepatobiliary Cancers v2.2024; [Westgaard et al., Ann Surg Oncol 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)

## Plain-English summary

Ampullary and duodenal cancers are diagnosed via endoscopy or surgery, then classified by histology (intestinal vs pancreatobiliary) and molecular profile. The subtype predicts behavior: pancreatobiliary tumors act like pancreatic cancer, while intestinal tumors resemble colorectal cancer in outcomes.

## Workup components

1. **Symptoms:** jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, gastric outlet obstruction, GI bleeding.
2. **Testing:**
   - Labs: LFTs, bilirubin fractionation, CA 19-9, CEA.
   - Imaging: multiphasic pancreas-protocol CT or MRI/MRCP.
   - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with FNA or ERCP brushing/biopsies.
   - Surgical pathology when Whipple performed.
3. **Pathology review:** immunostains (CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2, CDX2) plus mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).

## Histologic subtypes

| Subtype | Features | Median survival (localized) |
|---------|----------|-----------------------------|
| **Intestinal** | CK20+, MUC2+, CDX2+, resembles colorectal mucosa | 30–40 months |
| **Pancreatobiliary** | CK7+, MUC1+, aggressive stroma, KRAS mutations frequent | 12–20 months |
| **Mixed** | Areas of both | Intermediate |

Pancreatobiliary histology correlates with higher nodal burden and earlier liver metastasis.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)

## Molecular features

- **KRAS** mutations in ~40–60% (G12D, G12V); KRAS G12C (~3–4%) now targetable with sotorasib/adagrasib.
- **TP53**, **SMAD4**, **CDKN2A** changes mirror pancreatic cancer.
- **MSI-H/dMMR** present in 3–5% (more common in intestinal type) ? pembrolizumab eligibility.
- **HER2 amplification/overexpression** ~5–15%; confirm with IHC + FISH before trastuzumab.
- **BRCA1/2, PALB2** germline/somatic alterations (2–4%) ? PARP inhibitor discussions.
- **NTRK/ALK/ROS1 fusions** rare (<1%) but actionable.

## Differential diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing clues |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma | Bulk in pancreatic head, SMV/SMA encasement, CA 19-9 >1000 |
| Distal cholangiocarcinoma | Expands distal bile duct, more periductal-infiltrating pattern |
| Duodenal adenocarcinoma | Lesion located away from papilla, may be villous |
| Neuroendocrine tumor | Chromogranin/synaptophysin+, well-circumscribed |

## Liver metastasis confirmation

- Use MRI with hepatobiliary agent (gadoxetate) or contrast CT.
- Biopsy if histology is uncertain, or if considering clinical trial requiring tissue.
- Evaluate for portal vein thrombosis and biliary dilation extent before interventions.

## Biliary obstruction toolbox

| Approach | When used | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| ERCP with stent | First-line for most obstructions | SEMS > plastic for expected survival >4 months |
| EUS-guided biliary drainage | When duodenal stenosis prevents ERCP | Requires experienced advanced endoscopist |
| PTBD/PTHC | Altered anatomy, failed ERCP/EUS, or urgent decompression | Educate about drain care, infection risk |
