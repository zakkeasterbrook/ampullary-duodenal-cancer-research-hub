| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Ampullary carcinoma** | Cancer arising where the bile duct and pancreatic duct join and empty into the duodenum (ampulla of Vater). |
| **Duodenal adenocarcinoma** | Malignancy originating from the glandular lining of the duodenum (first part of small intestine). |
| **Pancreatobiliary subtype** | Histologic pattern resembling pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; often harbor KRAS/TP53 mutations. |
| **Intestinal subtype** | Histology similar to colorectal cancer; more likely to respond to 5-FU/oxaliplatin regimens and be MSI-high. |
| **ECOG performance status** | Scale from 0 (fully active) to 5 (dead) describing a patient's ability to perform daily activities; guides treatment intensity. |
| **FOLFIRINOX** | Combination chemo regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) used for pancreatic-like cancers. |
| **CAPOX / XELOX** | Capecitabine (oral 5-FU prodrug) plus oxaliplatin. |
| **Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel** | Standard doublet therapy for pancreatic/biliary cancers. |
| **Biliary stent** | Tube placed endoscopically to keep bile ducts open; can be plastic (temporary) or metal (longer term). |
| **ERCP** | Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography; procedure to visualize and treat biliary/pancreatic duct issues. |
| **External biliary drain (PTBD)** | Percutaneous tube draining bile outside the body when internal stenting fails. |
| **CA19-9** | Tumor marker used to follow disease trend; influenced by biliary obstruction. |
| **MMR/MSI** | Mismatch repair / Microsatellite instability; biomarkers predicting immunotherapy response. |
| **ctDNA** | Circulating tumor DNA detected in blood that mirrors tumor mutations. |
| **TMB** | Tumor Mutational Burden; number of mutations per megabase, guiding immunotherapy use. |
| **HRD** | Homologous recombination deficiency; makes tumors sensitive to platinum and PARP inhibitors. |
| **Celiac plexus block** | Procedure to interrupt pain signals from abdominal organs. |
| **SBRT** | Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy; delivers high-dose radiation precisely to limited targets. |
| **NCCN / ESMO / ASCO** | Major oncology guideline bodies (US, Europe, international). |
| **Palliative care** | Specialty focused on symptom control and quality of life throughout serious illness, not just end-of-life. |
| **NGS** | Next-generation sequencing; technology to read DNA/RNA for mutations/fusions. |
| **Germline testing** | DNA testing of normal cells to find inherited cancer risk mutations. |
| **PARP inhibitor** | Drug class targeting DNA repair, e.g., olaparib, talazoparib. |
| **TACE / Y-90** | Liver-directed therapies: Transarterial chemoembolization / yttrium-90 radioembolization. |
