# Clinician Mode: data-dense digest

**Summary:** Pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma with liver metastases should be staged with AJCC 8th edition (pT/pN + M1), managed like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and sequenced through FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based therapy, with biomarker-driven pivots whenever possible.

> **Evidence strength:** Guideline — NCCN Hepatobiliary Cancers v2.2024; ESMO HPB Guidelines 2023

## Diagnostic refinements

- **Histologic subtyping** (intestinal, pancreatobiliary, mixed) and **immunophenotype** (CK7/CK20, MUC1/MUC2) influence survival.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)
- Recommend **broad NGS (DNA + RNA)** because rates of actionable targets approach 25% when including HER2, MSI-H, NTRK, BRAF V600E, BRCA/PALB2, and KRAS G12C.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32936510/)
- **MRCP or contrast MRI** outperforms CT for delineating biliary obstruction; add liver-specific contrast (gadoxetate) when mapping stereotactic radiation fields.

## Staging snapshot (AJCC 8)

| Domain | Key points |
|--------|------------|
| T | Invasion depth into duodenal wall, pancreas, or adjacent structures |
| N | 0 vs 1–2 vs =3 regional nodes; >4 nodes portend pancreatic-like outcomes |
| M | Distant mets (liver most common) = stage IV |

Margin status (R0 vs R1) only applies if a Whipple was performed; in metastatic disease, surgery is palliative.

## Prognostic markers

- **Histology:** pancreatobiliary type median OS 12–18 mo despite therapy; intestinal 30+ mo in localized disease.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)
- **Nodal burden:** =4 positive nodes halves survival vs =2.[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21102258/)
- **Molecular:** MSI-H and TMB-high (~3–5%) predict durable responses to pembrolizumab; HER2 amplification (~5–15%) predicts trastuzumab benefit in biliary cancers.[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30916619/) 
- **Performance status:** ECOG =2 associated with 3× higher hospitalization risk during FOLFIRINOX.

## Systemic therapy ladder (metastatic)

| Line | Regimen | Evidence/Response | Notes |
|------|---------|------------------|-------|
| 1st | Modified FOLFIRINOX | ORR 31–45%, median OS ~15 mo in biliary cohorts[5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194228/) | Consider 80% doses, omit bolus 5-FU, add G-CSF for age 75+ |
| 1st (alternative) | Gemcitabine + cisplatin ± durvalumab | ORR 26%, median OS 12.9 mo; durva adds 1.6 mo (TOPAZ-1)[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35094080/) | Favor when renal function adequate; cholangitis risk requires stent optimization |
| 1st (frail) | Gemcitabine + capecitabine or single-agent capecitabine | OS 8–10 mo in ampullary subset | Oral option; monitor hand-foot syndrome |
| 2nd | FOLFOX (ABC-06) | OS benefit vs SOC (6.2 vs 5.3 mo)[7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33979517/) | Manage neuropathy, cytopenias |
| 2nd/3rd | Irinotecan- or liposomal irinotecan-based regimens | Small biliary cohorts show disease control ~35% | UGT1A1 genotyping recommended |
| Targeted | Trastuzumab ± pertuzumab (HER2), larotrectinib/entrectinib (NTRK), sotorasib/adagrasib (KRAS G12C), olaparib (BRCA/PALB2) | Response rates 20–50% depending on alteration | Confirm on CGP report and payer authorization |
| Immunotherapy | Pembrolizumab (MSI-H/dMMR or TMB =10), dostarlimab (dMMR) | Durable CRs documented; KEYNOTE-158 biliary cohort DCR 41% | Requires prior progression or frontline for TMB-high |

## Biliary procedures snapshot

- **Metal stents** (SEMS) preferred for >4 months survival expectation; plastic if short bridging or infection risk.
- **Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)** or **percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTHC)** used when ERCP fails or altered anatomy exists.
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis** essential when biliary drainage manipulations occur in patients on cytotoxic therapy.

## Radiation & locoregional strategies

- **Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)** to dominant liver lesions achieves local control ~70% with BED =80 Gy; use with systemic therapy.[8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34626552/)
- **Y-90 radioembolization** evidence limited to case series but can palliate cholangitis and reduce bilirubin to enable chemotherapy.

## Supportive must-haves

- Early palliative care consult, pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat-soluble vitamin checks, bone health monitoring (DXA) for steroid/PPIs.
- Vaccinate against influenza, pneumococcus, COVID-19 before chemotherapy when possible.
