# FAQ & Myth-Busting

### “Is ampullary cancer the same as pancreatic cancer?”
**No.** Ampullary tumors start at the duct junction; pancreatic tumors arise inside the pancreas. Treatments overlap but prognosis and biomarker profiles differ. Think of ampullary as a border town that can behave like pancreas *or* intestine depending on subtype.

### “Does everyone need a Whipple?”
Only if the tumor hasn’t spread and vessels aren’t invaded. Many patients receive chemo +/- radiation first, and some never qualify. If inoperable, stents or bypass procedures keep bile flowing.

### “How fast does it grow?”
Pancreatobiliary subtype often acts fast (months), intestinal subtype slower (years). Performance status and liver function drive urgency.

### “Can chemo be skipped if stents relieve symptoms?”
Relieving obstruction doesn’t treat the underlying cancer. Systemic therapy is still needed unless goals of care shift to comfort-only.

### “Are drains forever?”
Sometimes. Plastic stents last weeks, metal stents months. External drains may stay until chemotherapy shrinks the tumor or a surgical bypass is placed.

### “Do alternative protocols (ivermectin, fenbendazole) cure cancer?”
No credible clinical trials prove cures. They remain anecdotal. See [Alternative Toolkit](alternative-toolkit.md) for evidence levels, risks, and links before considering them.

### “Is diarrhea normal on enzymes?”
Loose stools often mean enzyme dose is too low or meals lack fat. Adjust per dietitian guidance; call oncology if severe or bloody.

### “Can immunotherapy work if I’m not MSI-H?”
Durvalumab + gem/cis shows benefit even in MSI-stable disease (TOPAZ-1). Other checkpoint therapies require biomarkers or trial setting.

### “When should we go to the ER?”
Fever ≥100.4°F, severe abdominal pain, uncontrollable vomiting, no drain output, confusion, or breathing trouble. Use the [Symptom Dashboard](symptom-dashboard.md) for quick decisions.

### “What does success look like?”
Stabilized bilirubin, manageable pain, weight maintenance, and longer scan intervals. Celebrate small wins (restful night, stable labs) while planning next-line options.
