# Deep Science Map

This section dives beneath the bedside checklists into the circuitry of ampullary and duodenal cancers—so researchers, clinicians, and data geeks can hunt for leverage points.

## 1. Anatomy recap: the three-way junction

- **Ampulla of Vater** = confluence of bile duct (liver) + main pancreatic duct + duodenal mucosa.
- **Blood supply** from pancreaticoduodenal arcades drains into portal vein → liver, explaining why micrometastases land there first.
- **Lymphatic drainage** hits peripancreatic → hepatoduodenal → celiac chains.

**Analogy:** imagine two highways (bile + pancreas) merging into a roundabout (ampulla). Cancers start when the traffic lights fail; rogue drivers spill into any exit—liver, nodes, peritoneum.

## 2. Histologic identity = behavior

| Feature | Intestinal type | Pancreatobiliary type |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Dominant markers | CK20+, CDX2, MUC2 | CK7+, MUC1, CA19-9 high |
| KRAS | 20–30% | 60–80% |
| MSI-H/dMMR | Up to 15% | Rare (<3%) |
| Stroma | Thin, villous | Dense desmoplasia with CAFs |
| Prognosis | Better OS, responds to 5-FU/oxaliplatin | Worse OS, needs pancreatic-style chemo |

## 3. Metastatic cascade

1. **Ductal obstruction** increases intraductal pressure → microtears → tumor cells enter venous flow.
2. **Portal circulation** carries cells straight to liver sinusoids (first-pass effect).
3. **Tumor microenvironment** in liver is immunosuppressive (Kupffer cells + TGF-β). Pancreatobiliary tumors often lose SMAD4, reducing TGF-β restraint and allowing colony formation.
4. **Peritoneal spread** arises when tumors erode serosa or leaks occur during intervention.

## 4. Metabolic wiring

- **KRAS-driven glycolysis**: high GLUT1, LDHA expression → lactate accumulation and acidic microenvironment.
- **Glutamine addiction**: tumors tap pancreatic enzymes + bile salts to harvest amino acids.
- **Bile acid signaling**: FXR and TGR5 pathways modulated by bacteria; cholestasis alters microbiome, impacting immune tone.
- **Therapeutic angle:** combine metabolic hits (metformin/phenformin, asparaginase, fasting-mimicking diets) with chemo under dietitian/oncologist supervision.

## 5. Immune landscape

| Component | Observation | Potential play |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes | Higher in intestinal / MSI-H tumors | Rationale for checkpoint inhibitors |
| M2 macrophages + CAFs | Dense in pancreatobiliary type, secrete TGF-β, IL-6 | TGF-β inhibitors, LOX/CAF targeting trials |
| Microbiome | Bile duct colonization by Enterococcus/Enterobacter shifts bile acids → inflammation | Research combos of antibiotics/probiotics with chemo |

## 6. Why liver drains fail

- **Biofilm** on plastic stents fosters bacterial cholangitis.
- **Sludge from chemo** (cell debris + biliary salts) clogs narrow lumens.
- **Tip:** use metal stents when life expectancy >4 months; schedule pre-emptive exchanges; track Kelvins (bilirubin) to predict occlusion.

## 7. Molecular notebooks

| Pathway | Alterations | Drugs/ideas |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **KRAS/RAF/MEK** | KRAS G12D/V > G12C; occasional BRAF V600E | G12C inhibitors (adagrasib + EGFR), MEK combos, adoptive T-cell trials |
| **DNA repair** | BRCA1/2, PALB2, ATM | Platinum sensitivity, PARP inhibitors (olaparib), ATR inhibitors |
| **WNT/β-catenin** | RNF43, APC mutations (intestinal type) | Porcupine inhibitors, tankyrase blockers (research stage) |
| **HER2/ERBB2** | Amplification 5–15% | Trastuzumab + chemo, T-DXd, tucatinib combos |
| **FGFR2/NTRK** | Rare fusions | Pemigatinib/futibatinib, larotrectinib/entrectinib |

## 8. Systems-level analogies

- **Plumbing**: Bile ducts = pipes. Tumor is tree roots. Drains/stents = plumber repairs.
- **Power grid**: Liver = substation; pancreas = battery. Tumor shorts circuits; chemo rewires.
- **Firewall breach**: Immune system = security team. MSI-H tumors have obvious intruders; MSI-stable hide in stealth mode.

## 9. Data wish list

1. **ctDNA dashboards** correlating VAF shifts with bilirubin + CA19-9.
2. **Drain outcome registry** capturing stent type, flush protocol, infection events.
3. **Metabolic panels** tracking ketones/glucose vs fatigue.
4. **Microbiome swabs** before/after antibiotics, linked to symptom diaries.
