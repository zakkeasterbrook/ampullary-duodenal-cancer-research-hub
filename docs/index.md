## How to use this hub

1. **Start Here** translates jargon for families and highlights the first 72 hours of decisions—with analogies a high-schooler can share.
2. **Clinician Mode** aggregates granular data (subtype genomics, response rates, biomarker algorithms).
3. **Treatments** drills down on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and procedures for biliary obstruction.
4. **Real-world experiences** summarize patterns from Inspire, Reddit, Cancer Survivors Network, and public blogs—clearly labeled as anecdotal.
5. **Practical Playbook** offers week-by-week checklists, question lists, and second-opinion tactics.

## Contribute & collaborate

- Read the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for citation rules and templates.
- Drop caregiver stories or research using the [Community Hub](community/README.md) templates.
- Automation agents (OpenClaw, etc.) follow the [Agent Playbook](AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md) for fast, safe updates.

## What "evidence-ranked" means

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Guideline** | NCCN, ESMO, ASCO, or NCI PDQ consensus |
| **Randomized / Phase III** | Peer-reviewed randomized trials |
| **Phase II / Cohort** | Prospective or retrospective cohorts |
| **Case series / Mechanistic** | Small series, translational biology |
| **Anecdote** | Forum report, blog, or single-case write-up |

## Key takeaways upfront

- **Pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma behaves like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** and therefore often uses pancreatic protocols (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine-based doublets). *Guideline level.*
- **Liver metastasis at diagnosis usually makes the disease stage IV (palliative intent)**, but carefully selected patients can still undergo biliary decompression, stereotactic radiation, or metastasis-directed therapy to control symptoms. *Guideline + cohort.*
- **Performance status and organ function drive regimen choice for older adults.** Dose-modified FOLFIRINOX or doublets (CAPOX, FOLFOX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) are common if creatinine clearance and neuropathy risk allow. *Cohort level.*
- **Actionable biomarkers exist:** MSI-H/dMMR, TMB-high, NTRK fusions, HER2 amplification, BRCA/PALB2, and KRAS G12C each open targeted options. *Guideline + FDA label.*
- **Community reports emphasize** early palliative care, nutrition consults, and pancreatic enzyme replacement to stabilize daily function; delaying stent exchanges or biliary drain maintenance often triggered emergency admissions. *Anecdotal pattern.*

Explore, verify with your clinical team, and adapt for the patient’s goals and performance status.
