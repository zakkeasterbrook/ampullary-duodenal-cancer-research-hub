## Quick answers (3-minute read)

- **Top symptoms to act on:** fever with chills, rising bilirubin/itch, new confusion, uncontrolled pain. Go to ER for cholangitis, drain clogs, or sudden weakness.
- **Pain scale reality check:** mild (0–3) = Tylenol, heat packs; moderate (4–6) = add opioids + nerve blocks; severe (7–10) requires ER or urgent palliative consult.
- **Chemo at a glance:** FOLFIRINOX = strongest shrinkage; Gem/Cis(+Durva) = steady workhorse; CAPOX/FOLFOX = maintenance/second line; capecitabine = gentle “keep moving” pill.
- **Home care wins:** routine drain flushes, enzyme pills before food, hydration goal = 30 mL/kg/day, log every bowel movement.
- **Mindset:** every small stability (labs, appetite, sleep) buys time for trials and stronger regimens. Celebrate wins weekly.

## Pain & symptom survival kit

- **Biliary itch fix:** cholestyramine packet + antihistamine at night + lukewarm showers.
- **Drain care mantra:** flush, secure, cover. Keep spare caps, log output, have IR phone number pinned.
- **Nausea stack:** ondansetron (set an alarm), add olanzapine nights 1–4, then ginger chews + walking laps.
- **Neuropathy guard:** frozen peas on hands during oxaliplatin, slip-on shoes, PT referral at first tingle.
- **Mood & sleep:** 10-minute gratitude voice note, melatonin 3 mg, ask for low-dose mirtazapine if appetite/sleep both crash.

## At-home survival toolkit

- **Hydration & nutrition:** aim for 30 mL/kg/day fluids; pair every infusion with enzyme capsules + 15g protein snack. See [Integrative & Supportive Care](supportive-care.md).
- **Week-by-week planner:** use the [Practical Playbook](practical-playbook.md) for checklists (labs, drain swaps, rest days).
- **Pain ladder magnet:** print the pain scale + ER triggers from [Start Here](start-here.md) and stick it on the fridge.
- **Mindset corner:** keep a "3 wins" notebook; evidence shows gratitude + purposeful routines improve tolerance.

## Chemo cheat sheet (plain language)

| Regimen | How it feels | Why use it |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **FOLFIRINOX (modified)** | Strong punch; expect fatigue days 2–4, possible diarrhea, numb fingers | Best tumor shrinker for pancreatobiliary type when patient is sturdy |
| **Gemcitabine + Cisplatin (+Durvalumab)** | Rhythm routine: day 1 & 8 infusions, off week to recover; watch kidneys & hearing | Standard for most biliary cancers; durva adds immune boost |
| **Gemcitabine + Nab-Paclitaxel** | Similar to pancreatic regimens; neuropathy tends to creep in | Used when cisplatin or irinotecan aren’t options |
| **CAPOX / FOLFOX** | IV plus oral capecitabine “chemo pills”; hands/feet need extra lotion | Adjuvant after surgery or second-line maintenance |
| **Capecitabine solo** | Pill only, manageable at home | For frail patients or maintenance between scans |

## Biomarkers & trial router

1. Run the full panel (MMR/MSI, HER2, KRAS, BRCA/PALB2, TMB, NTRK/FGFR) → see [Biomarkers & Testing](biomarkers.md).
2. Match to trials using the filters + outreach email inside [Clinical Trials](clinical-trials.md).
3. Log results in the Community Hub so others can see what doors opened.

## Idea Lab & future cures

- Explore emerging combos, AI prompts, and home experiments in the [Future Frontiers](future-frontiers.md) page.
- Submit anonymized clinic-note digests + scans via [Share Data Safely](share-data.md) so agents can map symptom → intervention → outcome.
- Request help or co-researchers by opening a “New Topic” issue tagged **Idea Lab**.

## Real people, real wins

- “We treated the drain like a kitchen sink clean-out—flushed daily, never hit the ER again.” — Caregiver, Ohio.
- “Dose-reduced FOLFIRINOX still shrank liver spots; palliative PT kept mom walking.” — Daughter, 2025.
- “Monthly gratitude calls kept morale high; oncologist said mindset mattered when scans stabilized.” — Patient, 2026.

## How to use this hub

1. **Start Here** translates jargon for families and highlights the first 72 hours of decisions—with analogies a high-schooler can share.
2. **Clinician Mode** aggregates granular data (subtype genomics, response rates, biomarker algorithms).
3. **Treatments** drills down on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and procedures for biliary obstruction.
4. **Real-world experiences** summarize patterns from Inspire, Reddit, Cancer Survivors Network, and public blogs—clearly labeled as anecdotal.
5. **Practical Playbook** offers week-by-week checklists, question lists, and second-opinion tactics.

## Contribute & collaborate

- Read the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for citation rules and templates.
- Drop caregiver stories, clinic-note digests, or research using the [Community Hub](community/README.md) templates.
- Automation agents (OpenClaw, etc.) follow the [Agent Playbook](AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md) for fast, safe updates.

## What "evidence-ranked" means

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Guideline** | NCCN, ESMO, ASCO, or NCI PDQ consensus |
| **Randomized / Phase III** | Peer-reviewed randomized trials |
| **Phase II / Cohort** | Prospective or retrospective cohorts |
| **Case series / Mechanistic** | Small series, translational biology |
| **Anecdote** | Forum report, blog, or single-case write-up |

## Key takeaways upfront

- **Pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma behaves like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** and therefore often uses pancreatic protocols (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine-based doublets). *Guideline level.*
- **Liver metastasis at diagnosis usually makes the disease stage IV (palliative intent)**, but carefully selected patients can still undergo biliary decompression, stereotactic radiation, or metastasis-directed therapy to control symptoms. *Guideline + cohort.*
- **Performance status and organ function drive regimen choice for older adults.** Dose-modified FOLFIRINOX or doublets (CAPOX, FOLFOX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) are common if creatinine clearance and neuropathy risk allow. *Cohort level.*
- **Actionable biomarkers exist:** MSI-H/dMMR, TMB-high, NTRK fusions, HER2 amplification, BRCA/PALB2, and KRAS G12C each open targeted options. *Guideline + FDA label.*
- **Community reports emphasize** early palliative care, nutrition consults, and pancreatic enzyme replacement to stabilize daily function; delaying stent exchanges or biliary drain maintenance often triggered emergency admissions. *Anecdotal pattern.*

Explore, verify with your clinical team, and adapt for the patient’s goals and performance status.
