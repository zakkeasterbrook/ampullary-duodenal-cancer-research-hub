## What is ampullary/duodenal cancer?

Think of the ampulla as the “power junction” where the liver’s bile duct and the pancreas’s enzyme duct plug into the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). When cells there mutate:
- **Pancreatobiliary-type** tumors act like pancreatic cancer—fast-growing “grease fires” that need aggressive chemo.
- **Intestinal-type** tumors behave more like colon cancer—slower “brush fires” that often respond to 5-FU/oxaliplatin.
- Once cancer slips into the bloodstream or lymph (liver mets, peritoneal spread), it becomes stage IV and systemic therapy is the main weapon.

**Analogy:** Picture the biliary tree as a plumbing system. The tumor is either tree roots clogging the drain (causing jaundice) or a frayed electrical junction shorting the circuit (malabsorption, pain). Treatment first stabilizes the plumbing/electric, then attacks the root problem.

## Quick answers (3-minute read)

- **Top symptoms to act on:** fever with chills, rising bilirubin/itch, new confusion, uncontrolled pain. ER for cholangitis, drain clogs, sudden weakness.
- **Pain scale reality check:** 0–3 = Tylenol/heat packs; 4–6 = add opioids + nerve blocks; 7–10 = ER or urgent palliative consult.
- **Chemo at a glance:** FOLFIRINOX = strongest shrinkage; Gem/Cis(+Durva) = workhorse; CAPOX/FOLFOX = maintenance; capecitabine = gentle “keep moving” pill.
- **Home care wins:** drain flush routine, enzymes before food, hydration 30 mL/kg/day, bowel log.
- **Mindset:** every small stability (labs, appetite, sleep) buys time. Celebrate wins weekly.

## How it spreads & why drains matter

- Tumor blocks bile flow → bilirubin climbs → infection risk. Stents/drains are like emergency bypass pipes.
- Cancer cells hitch rides in lymph/blood → liver/peritoneum. Imaging (CT/MRI) maps spread; biomarkers predict fuel sources.
- Without drains, chemo can’t start. Keep stents flushed, schedule exchanges every 6–8 weeks, and track skin color/itch to catch clogs.

## Pain & symptom survival kit

- **Biliary itch fix:** cholestyramine packet + antihistamine at night + lukewarm showers.
- **Drain care mantra:** flush, secure, cover. Keep spare caps, log output, have IR number pinned.
- **Nausea stack:** ondansetron on schedule, add olanzapine nights 1–4, then ginger walks.
- **Neuropathy guard:** frozen peas during oxaliplatin, slip-on shoes, PT referral at first tingle.
- **Mood & sleep:** 10-minute gratitude voice note, melatonin 3 mg, low-dose mirtazapine if appetite/sleep crash.

## At-home survival toolkit

- **Hydration & nutrition:** aim for 30 mL/kg/day; pair every meal with enzymes + protein snack (see [Integrative & Supportive Care](supportive-care.md)).
- **Week-by-week planner:** [Practical Playbook](practical-playbook.md) tracks labs, drain swaps, rest days.
- **Pain ladder magnet:** print triggers from [Start Here](start-here.md) and stick on fridge.
- **Mindset corner:** “3 wins” notebook + music you love; resilience improves chemo tolerance.

## Chemo 101 (plain language)

| Regimen | How it works (analogy) | How it feels | Why use it |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|------------|
| **FOLFIRINOX (modified)** | Multi-tool jackhammer smashing fast cells | Strong punch; fatigue days 2–4, possible diarrhea, numb fingers | Best shrinkage for pancreatobiliary subtype |
| **Gemcitabine + Cisplatin (+Durvalumab)** | Twin pressure washers plus immune spotlight | Day 1 & 8 infusions, off week to recover; watch kidneys/hearing | Standard biliary regimen; durva adds immune boost |
| **Gemcitabine + Nab-Paclitaxel** | Sandblaster for stubborn plaques | Similar to pancreatic regimens; neuropathy creeps in | When cisplatin/irinotecan aren’t options |
| **CAPOX / FOLFOX** | IV primer + oral “paint” sealing leftover cells | Hands/feet need lotion; easier clinic schedule | Adjuvant or second-line maintenance |
| **Capecitabine solo** | Gentle weatherproof coat | Pill-only, manageable at home | Frail patients or maintenance between scans |

## Beyond chemo: targeted, immuno, alternatives

- **Biomarker playbook:** [Biomarkers & Testing](biomarkers.md) explains HER2, MSI-H, KRAS G12C, BRCA/PALB2, NTRK, FGFR, TMB. Match results to trials via [Clinical Trials](clinical-trials.md).
- **Immunotherapy:** MSI-H/dMMR or TMB-high tumors often respond to pembrolizumab/dostarlimab; TOPAZ-1 adds durvalumab even to MSI-stable disease.
- **Alternative toolkit:** Curious about ivermectin, fenbendazole, high-dose vitamin C, mistletoe, HBOT, etc.? Read evidence, risks, and community links at the [Alternative Toolkit](alternative-toolkit.md) before trying anything.

## Biomarkers & trial router

1. Run the full panel (MMR/MSI, HER2, KRAS, BRCA/PALB2, TMB, NTRK/FGFR).
2. Use the filters + outreach scripts in [Clinical Trials](clinical-trials.md) to contact coordinators.
3. Share outcomes in the Community Hub so others learn fast.

## Idea Lab & future cures

- Explore emerging combos, AI prompts, and home experiments in [Future Frontiers](future-frontiers.md).
- Submit anonymized clinic-note digests via [Share Data Safely](share-data.md).
- Request collaborators by opening a “New Topic” issue tagged **Idea Lab**.

## Real people, real wins

- “We treated the drain like a kitchen sink clean-out—flushed daily, never hit the ER again.” — Caregiver, Ohio.
- “Dose-reduced FOLFIRINOX still shrank liver spots; palliative PT kept mom walking.” — Daughter, 2025.
- “Monthly gratitude calls kept morale high; oncologist said mindset mattered when scans stabilized.” — Patient, 2026.

## How to use this hub

1. **Start Here** translates jargon for families and highlights the first 72 hours of decisions—with analogies a high-schooler can share.
2. **Clinician Mode** aggregates granular data (subtype genomics, response rates, biomarker algorithms).
3. **Treatments** drills down on chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and procedures for biliary obstruction.
4. **Real-world experiences** summarize patterns from Inspire, Reddit, Cancer Survivors Network, and public blogs—clearly labeled as anecdotal.
5. **Practical Playbook** offers week-by-week checklists, question lists, and second-opinion tactics.

## Key takeaways upfront

- **Pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma behaves like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** and therefore often uses pancreatic protocols (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine-based doublets). *Guideline level.*
- **Liver metastasis at diagnosis usually makes the disease stage IV (palliative intent)**, but carefully selected patients can still undergo biliary decompression, stereotactic radiation, or metastasis-directed therapy to control symptoms. *Guideline + cohort.*
- **Performance status and organ function drive regimen choice for older adults.** Dose-modified FOLFIRINOX or doublets (CAPOX, FOLFOX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) are common if creatinine clearance and neuropathy risk allow. *Cohort level.*
- **Actionable biomarkers exist:** MSI-H/dMMR, TMB-high, NTRK fusions, HER2 amplification, BRCA/PALB2, and KRAS G12C each open targeted options. *Guideline + FDA label.*
- **Community reports emphasize** early palliative care, nutrition consults, and pancreatic enzyme replacement to stabilize daily function; delaying stent exchanges or biliary drain maintenance often triggered emergency admissions. *Anecdotal pattern.*

Explore, verify with your clinical team, and adapt for the patient’s goals and performance status.
