# Practical Playbook

Operational checklists to keep care moving. Adapt for your timeline and medical team.

## Week-by-week roadmap (first 8 weeks)

| Week | Primary objectives | Key tasks |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| 0 | Diagnosis stabilization | Confirm pathology subtype, obtain staging CT/MRI, manage biliary drainage, baseline labs (CBC, CMP, CA19-9), initiate enzymes |
| 1 | Build the team | Schedule consultations (medical oncology, surgical/hepatobiliary, palliative care, nutrition), set up shared medical binder, request comprehensive NGS + germline testing |
| 2 | Decide frontline therapy | Review chemo options, evaluate port placement, map infusion center logistics, prehabilitate (PT/OT) |
| 3 | Start treatment | Verify antiemetic regimen, arrange transportation + caregiver shifts, order home IV hydration if needed |
| 4 | Monitor response/toxicity | Lab tracking twice weekly if bilirubin labile, neuropathy screening, stool/weight log |
| 5 | Reassess support systems | Palliative follow-up, home health services, schedule respite care slots, update advanced directive |
| 6 | Imaging milestone | Plan first restaging scan (typically after 2–3 cycles), prep insurance authorization |
| 7–8 | Iterate plan | Adjust doses, evaluate trial referrals, revisit goals of care discussion |

## Daily/weekly command center

```text
Morning
  [ ] Temp + drain output + pain score
  [ ] Medications taken? (antiemetic, enzymes, anticoagulant)
  [ ] Hydration goal 30 mL/kg/day → log ounces consumed

Evening
  [ ] Weight
  [ ] Stool count/consistency
  [ ] Neuropathy check (numbness, tingling)
  [ ] Mood/energy note (1–10)

Weekly
  [ ] Lab review call with nurse
  [ ] Pharmacy refill check
  [ ] Scan/appointment calendar updated
  [ ] Caregiver respite block scheduled
```

## Question sets for appointments

- **Medical oncologist**
  1. What are we measuring to judge success this month (labs vs imaging vs symptoms)?
  2. What dose modifications are on deck if bilirubin rises again?
  3. Which clinical trials would you consider next if progression occurs in 3 months?

- **Interventional GI / Hepatobiliary surgeon**
  1. What is the plan if the stent occludes over a weekend?
  2. Are we a candidate for metal stent conversion or rendezvous procedure?
  3. Can we train at home for drain flushing?

- **Palliative care**
  1. Are we layered enough on neuropathy meds before adding more opioids?
  2. What non-pharmacologic sleep strategies mesh with current prescriptions?
  3. How do we document emergency preferences (DNR, hospitalization) clearly?

## Logistics toolkit

- **Binder sections**: contact sheet, meds, labs, imaging, procedures, legal documents.
- **Digital**: shared Google Drive folder with PDFs + spreadsheet for labs and weight.
- **Supplies**: thermometer, blood pressure cuff, pill organizer, drain care kit, pump bag, oral care kit (baking soda rinses + soft toothbrush).
- **Transport**: list of drivers, Uber Health account, wheelchair-accessible cab numbers.

## Escalation matrix

| Trigger | Immediate action | Who to call |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Fever ≥100.4°F or shaking chills | Go to ER with emergency packet | On-call GI/oncology line |
| Drain stops output for >6 hours or sudden leakage | Clamp if instructed, cover site, head to interventional radiology/ER | IR team |
| New confusion, slurred speech, fall | Call 911; check glucose if diabetic | EMS / ER |
| CA19-9 doubling with new pain | Notify oncologist, request earlier imaging | Med onc |

## Communication templates

**Group text / Signal channel** for caregivers:
```
Daily meds done ✅
Drain output 450 mL, bilirubin labs tomorrow 9 AM.
Needs: ride to infusion Wed (any volunteers?).
```

**Treatment summary doc (one-pager):**
- Patient identifiers + allergies
- Diagnosis + stage + subtype
- Current regimen (dose, schedule)
- Devices (port, stent, drains)
- Recent complications + resolutions
- Contact list (oncologist, GI, palliative, pharmacy)

Keeping this playbook updated prevents last-minute scrambles and keeps everyone aligned on goals.
