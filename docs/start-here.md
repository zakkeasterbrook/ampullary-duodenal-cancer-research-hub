# Start Here: Families & Care Partners

**Plain-language summary:** When ampullary or duodenal cancer spreads to the liver or causes biliary blockage, the immediate goals are to keep bile flowing, stabilize nutrition, and choose a systemic therapy that matches subtype, fitness, and patient goals.

## First 72 hours checklist

| Task | Why it matters | Evidence |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Verify pathology subtype (intestinal vs pancreatobiliary) plus mismatch repair (MMR) status | Treatment selection and prognosis differ | *Guideline* |
| Ask whether a biliary stent or drain is needed immediately | Relieves jaundice, lowers infection risk | *Guideline* |
| Capture baseline labs (CBC, CMP, CA 19-9, CEA) and performance status (ECOG/Karnofsky) | Determines chemotherapy safety | *Guideline* |
| Request copies of imaging, pathology, and operative notes in digital format | Fast-tracks second opinions and clinical trial pre-screening | *Consensus* |
| Line up a palliative/supportive care consult | Symptom control improves survival and quality of life | *Randomized evidence* (Temel et al., NEJM 2010)

## Explaining the diagnosis

- **Ampullary carcinoma** starts where the bile duct and pancreatic duct empty into the duodenum. "Pancreatobiliary type" cells resemble pancreatic ductal cells and behave more aggressively than the intestinal subtype.[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19641972/)
- **Duodenal adenocarcinoma** arises slightly farther downstream but is treated similarly when metastatic.[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998046/)
- **Metastatic** means the disease has traveled—most commonly to the liver, peritoneum, or distant lymph nodes. Systemic therapy becomes the primary treatment.

## Common symptom path

1. **Biliary obstruction** ? dark urine, pale stools, itching, jaundice.
2. **Stent or percutaneous drain (PTBD/PTHC)** ? usually needed before chemo; plastic stents clog sooner than metal.
3. **Weight loss and pancreatic insufficiency** ? pancreatic enzyme capsules (pancrelipase) help fat digestion.[3](https://www.nccn.org/guidelines)
4. **Abdominal pain or gastric outlet symptoms** ? may require nerve blocks, radiation, or enteral stents.

## Elderly (79 y/o) considerations

- Request a **geriatric assessment** (cognition, falls, polypharmacy) before chemotherapy. *Guideline: ASCO 2020 Older Adults Oncology.*
- Dose-modified regimens (e.g., 80% FOLFIRINOX, CAPOX q3w, gemcitabine alone) can still provide disease control with fewer hospitalizations.[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194228/)
- Clarify code status, advance directives, and priorities (symptom relief vs tumor shrinkage) early.

## What to ask at the first oncology visit

1. What **stage** is the cancer and which imaging confirms it?
2. Has the pathology been reviewed by a tertiary center?
3. Which **actionable biomarkers** have been or will be tested?
4. What are the **top two chemotherapy options** for my situation, and what data supports them?
5. How will side effects be managed (antiemetics, neuropathy monitoring, growth factors)?
6. When should we call the clinic or go to the ER (fever, drain blockage, uncontrolled pain)?
7. Who coordinates **palliative care, nutrition, and physical therapy** locally?

## Family roles that matter most

- **Documentation lead:** organizes imaging discs, pathology PDFs, medication list.
- **Symptom tracker:** logs pain, stools, temperature, and drain output.
- **Insurance/benefits lead:** handles prior authorizations and out-of-network approvals.
- **Advocate for second opinions:** major centers (Johns Hopkins, MD Anderson, Mayo, Memorial Sloan Kettering) accept virtual reviews if records are complete.

## When emergencies happen

- **Cholangitis** (infection of the bile ducts) presents with fever, chills, and right upper quadrant pain—*call 911*.
- **Stent occlusion** ? jaundice or itching returning; contact the gastroenterologist immediately for ERCP or interventional radiology exchange.
- **New confusion or weakness** in an elderly patient on opioids or chemotherapy may signal dehydration, infection, or medication toxicity.
