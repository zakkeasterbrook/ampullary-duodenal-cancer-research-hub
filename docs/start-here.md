# Start Here: Families & Care Partners

**Plain-language summary:** Think of the body like a plumbing-and-power system. When ampullary or duodenal cancer blocks the bile “pipes” or spreads to the liver “power plant,” the first chores are keeping bile flowing, keeping calories coming in, and choosing medicine that fits the tumor type *and* the person’s strength.

## First 72 hours: “Stabilize the house” checklist

- **Confirm the blueprint (pathology + MMR/MSI status).** Different subtypes act more like colorectal vs pancreatic cancer, so the chemo playbook changes. *Guideline level.*
- **Unclog the drain (stent or external biliary drain).** If bilirubin is rising, get GI/interventional radiology to place/replace a stent before chemo. *Guideline level.*
- **Document vitals (labs + performance status).** CBC, CMP, CA19-9/CEA, and ECOG/Karnofsky tell the team which regimens are safe. *Guideline level.*
- **Collect every record digitally.** Imaging, pathology slides, operative notes—having a “go bag” speeds second opinions and clinical trial prescreens. *Consensus.*
- **Invite palliative/supportive care ASAP.** They manage pain, nausea, and drain issues—the data shows longer survival and better function when they join early. *Randomized evidence (Temel et al.).*

## Explain-it-like-we’re-new

- **Ampullary carcinoma** lives where the bile duct and pancreatic duct meet the small intestine. If it’s **pancreatobiliary type**, picture it behaving like pancreatic cancer—faster and stickier. **Intestinal type** behaves closer to colon cancer.
- **Duodenal adenocarcinoma** is a few inches downstream but, once metastatic, gets treated with the same systemic tools.
- **Metastatic** simply means it has road-tripped elsewhere (liver, peritoneum, distant nodes), so whole-body therapy is needed.

**Analogy:** If the bile duct is the home’s main sewer line, tumors are tree roots invading the pipe. Stents are the plumber’s temporary inserts that keep things draining while electricians (oncologists) rewire the power grid (systemic therapy).

## Symptom journey map

1. **Biliary obstruction** → dark urine, pale stools, itchy skin. Watch labs and call GI early.
2. **Stent or drain placement** → plastic = temporary, metal = longer lasting but usually placed once bilirubin is down.
3. **Pancreatic enzyme loss** → steatorrhea and weight loss. Enzyme capsules (Creon/Zenpep) act like dishwasher soap, breaking down fat so calories count.
4. **Pain or stomach blockage** → celiac plexus blocks, antiemetics, or stents can turn the volume down.

## For older adults (e.g., 79-year-old lens)

- Ask for a **geriatric assessment** (balance, memory, meds) before chemo. *ASCO guideline.*
- “Dial-down” regimens (80% FOLFIRINOX, CAPOX q3w, gemcitabine alone) still slow disease with fewer ER visits.[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194228/)
- Have the “goals talk” early: Is comfort, longevity, or a mix the top priority? Capture it in the chart.

## Questions for the first oncology visit

1. What stage are we, and what imaging proves it?
2. Has a tertiary center reviewed the pathology slides?
3. Which biomarkers (MMR/MSI, HER2, KRAS, BRCA, etc.) are pending or completed?
4. What are the top two regimen choices for *this* subtype + performance status, and what outcomes do they offer?
5. What side-effect rescue meds are pre-prescribed (antiemetics, neuropathy plans, pancreatic enzymes)?
6. Exact “call-us-now” triggers (temp ≥100.4°F, drain stops, uncontrolled pain)?
7. Who coordinates nutrition, PT/OT, and palliative care locally?

## Family/caregiver roles

- **Chief organizer:** keeps a shared drive with imaging, pathology PDFs, med list, and insurance cards.
- **Data logger:** tracks weight, drain output, stools, pain scores (spreadsheet or notebook).
- **Insurance warrior:** handles prior auths, travel claims, and grant applications.
- **Second-opinion scout:** emails major centers (Hopkins, Mayo, MSK, MD Anderson) with the complete “go bag.”

## Emergency cheat sheet

- **Cholangitis** = fever + chills + belly pain → ER immediately.
- **Stent clog** = jaundice or itching returns → call GI/IR; don’t wait for routine follow-up.
- **Sudden confusion/weakness** on chemo or opioids → check for dehydration, infection, med mix-ups, then escalate.
