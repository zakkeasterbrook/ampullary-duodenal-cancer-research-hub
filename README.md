# Ampullary & Duodenal Cancer Research Hub

A community-built guide to make rare upper-GI cancers less mysterious. We combine clinical evidence, crowd-sourced caregiver tactics, and plain-language explanations so families and clinicians can act faster.

## What makes this project different

- **Evidence-ranked summaries** of duodenal adenocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma treatments.
- **Plain-language storytelling** so families understand jargon with everyday analogies.
- **Open contribution model**: caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and automated agents can all submit updates.

## Quick start

1. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add research or caregiver notes.
2. Non-technical contributors can use GitHub’s web editor—no CLI required (step-by-step instructions included).
3. Agents and developers can run `mkdocs serve` locally for live preview, then open a pull request.

## Directory map

- `docs/` – Markdown source for every page.
- `docs/community/` – Templates & guides for new stories and research drops.
- `docs/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` – Workflow for OpenClaw and other automation agents.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` – Guided issue forms for new topics, corrections, and human stories.

## Tech stack

- [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for static site generation.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

## Mission

Rare cancers steal time because knowledge is scattered. This hub is our attempt to weaponize the internet’s collective intelligence—patients, caregivers, clinicians, and agents working together—to surface what helps, challenge what doesn’t, and push toward better outcomes.
